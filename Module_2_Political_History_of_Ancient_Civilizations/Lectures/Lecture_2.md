### 5. Summary:
In this lecture, we have traced the origins and evolution of democracy in Ancient Greece, highlighting key reforms, influential thinkers, and critical events that shaped its development. We have also discussed the inherent limitations of Athenian democracy and how these factors contributed to ongoing debates about governance that continue to resonate today.

### 6. Next Steps:

- Engage with contemporary discussions on democratic practices by comparing them with ancient models.
- Prepare for the next lecture on "The Role of Women and Non-Citizens in Ancient Political Systems," where we will further explore inclusivity and representation in governance throughout history. 

This lecture aims to not only inform but also inspire critical thinking about the complex legacy of ancient democratic practices and their relevance to modern political discourse.
